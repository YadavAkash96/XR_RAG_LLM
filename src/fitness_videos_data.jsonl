Up first, the seated leg curl for the hamstrings. This gets my knees nice and warm for squats, and I usually pick seated overlying leg curls because this study showed they cause about 1.5 times more muscle growth. Next I do Smith machine squats for the quads and glutes. Here I get as deep as I can and explode out of the hole. Doing these on the Smith allows me to push my last set to failure without worrying about dumping the bar. After that, it's the Romanian deadlift for the glutes and hamstrings. Here I focus on pushing my hips back without allowing my lower back to round. Using straps on these to smirk, your glutes and hams should be stronger than your grip. Then I do leg extensions for the quads. Here I set the seat back to get a deep stretch and erectus femoris. On my last set I do myoreps beyond failure. Basically, rest for a few seconds, crank another three reps, and repeat. Then I superset two sets of hip adductions for the inner thighs with two sets of hip abductions for the glutes. And then four sets of standing calf raises.", "platform": "YouTube"}

Here's what we found out. First, range of motion is the most important factor. You need to use a range of motion that gets the muscle fully stretched. You can do that by using a full range of motion, with a deep stretch, or by using long length partials. The second thing we found was the optimal lifting tempo. Each rep you do should last 2-8 seconds. That means you could do anything from a 1 second positive and a 1 second negative to a 1 second positive and a 7 second negative. The specific tempo doesn't seem to matter as much as simply controlling the negative and not just letting the weight free fall. And cheat reps do seem like a bad idea, but there's no study comparing ego lifting to strict form lifting yet. So that's the study we're going to do next, and I'll keep you guys posted on the results.", "platform": "YouTube"}

That's because they don't actually get the abdominal muscles close enough to failure to stimulate meaningful hypertrophy. This is still good exercise, but it is essentially just another form of cardio. Sure, you'll burn a few calories, but you're not building your six pack. Instead, to get your six pack to really pop, you'd be much better off doing progressive overload training just like you would for any other muscle. You do that by loading the abs with weight, and you really only need two exercises. One weight-loaded crunch and one leg raise. That's it. Try to add a rep or some weight each week. This way, the next time you cut down, your abs will pop much better.", "platform": "YouTube"}

Scientists had people train with either the seat up position with their hips flexed at around 90 degrees, or with the seat back position with their hips flexed at 40 degrees. After 10 weeks of training, here's the cool part, there was no difference in quad growth except one head called the rectus femoris grew way better with the seat back. It saw 170% more growth. This is a huge difference because the rectus femoris is a huge head. Does this mean that your quads are gonna look like J-Cutlers in eight weeks as long as you set the seat back? No, the actual amount of muscle gain was only a few millimeters. But compounded over years of training, I do think that doing your leg extensions with the seat back will lead to your best possible gains.", "platform": "YouTube"}

Now pull yourself under the bar with a close stance, placing the bar on top of your traps. Keep the grip close. Hands as close to the shoulders as you can manage. Hinge your back together and pull the bar down into your traps to tension the back. Slide the knees forward, placing the hips under the bar. Stand steady. Then step deliberately. One, two. Tuck and level your hips. Lightly screw the feet into the ground to help stabilize the hips. Breathe deep into your belly and brace like expecting a punch. Slide the hips back very slightly. Sink straight down between your legs. Depth may vary, but strive to lower to at least parallel. Keep the bar over the middle of your feet with equal balance from heel to toe.

If you do leg curls seated or lying like this, you'll target the hamstrings, adductors, and the calf, and you'll direct more growth lower towards the knee. If you point your toes out, you will target the muscles on the outside. Point them in, more inside. If you do calf raises with your legs straight, you'll target both the gastroc and the lower soleus.

Second, Reverse Nordics. These let you go much deeper than any leg extension machine will. Loop a band around a squat rack, kneel down, and lean back while keeping your hips straight. Go as low as you comfortably can and squeeze your quads to lift yourself up. Switch to body weight once you're strong enough. Third, Sissy Squats. Don't let the name fool you. These are hard. Grab a cable for balance and as you lean back, come up onto your toes and let your knees travel forward. Don't worry, studies show this won't hurt your knees. It'll make them stronger.

Well, the latest highest quality study in experience subjects actually found no difference between taking a set all the way to failure versus stopping one to two reps shy. But the problem is, if you never take any sets to failure, how are you supposed to know what one to two reps in the tank feels like? So that's why on pretty much every exercise, I just take the last set all the way to failure. Let me show you what that looks like for one of my leg days. So on the leg press, as you get close to failure, you're going to be really tempted to just let the weight free fall. But it's extremely important that as you do those last few reps, you still control the negative. Going to failure on the leg curl is kind of interesting because after you reach failure, you can't get the pad quite all the way down. You can still probably crank out another two or three partial reps. This is what I'll do on my last set. Going to failure on Bulgarian Swiss Squats is absolutely brutal, so I'd recommend doing two sets tops, your last set to failure. And again, with leg extensions, make sure you control the negative, especially as you get close to failure.", "platform": "YouTube"}

A scientist that recently discovered three solutions to their stubbornness. First, the standing calf raise is so insanely better than the seated calf raise. The gastropnemius grew more than 10 times more with standing versus seated, and the soleus grew the same. That's because when you bend your knee, you reduce the stretch on your gastro. But the key isn't that you're standing, the key is that you have a straight knee. Second, we all already knew that the calves needed deep stretch, but even more so than we realized. When you do calf raises, don't stop until you literally can't move the weight at all. This study found that the calves grew better from doing tiny partials beyond failure, even 8th reps and 10th reps. Though, until you literally can't budge the weight third, surprisingly, where you point your toes matters. Pointing your toes straight ahead hits the entire calf evenly. Pointing your toes out grows your inner calves more, and pointing your toes in grows your outer calves more. These researchers said that alternating your toes in and your toes out may cause the best growth of both heads.", "platform": "YouTube"}

If you take all five, you have a perfect leg press. The last one is what most people are confused about. First, place your feet for your goal. A higher foot position will target more glutes. A lower foot position will target more quads. How wide you go doesn't matter as much, but a round shoulder width is usually best. Point your toes slightly out. Second, control the weight down on every rep. Most people load up as many plates as they can, but then just let the weight free fall. It's better to go lighter and resist the weight on the negative. You want to notice your quads lengthening on the way down. Third, go as deep as you comfortably can. This is the most important step. For quad and glute growth, the deeper, the better. If you bottom out the machine, add an extra pad behind your back, or drop the weight back until you can get deep enough first, then build the weight back up. Fourth, grip the handles hard. As you do the positive, pull up on the handles to keep your glutes firmly planted on the seat. Fifth, lock out. It is generally safe to fully lock the knees out, but I try not to snap my knees at the top. I'll usually maintain a very slight knee bend at lock out.", "platform": "YouTube"}

Push these as hard and as heavy as you possibly can, imagining that you're curling the weight up to the ceiling with your pinky and ring fingers. Next, Crush Grip Dumbbell Curls for 3 sets of 15 reps. These will get your biceps and forearms wider when looking from a front view. Keep your elbows in and constantly crush the dumbbell inwards with your grip as you curl up to the top. Then, Single Arm Dumbbell Hammer Curls with a staggered stance and the plane of your shoulders open up to the side, really controlling the negatives down and focusing on keeping the crease of your elbow facing the ceiling. Then, an isometric hold for absolute max time. Using the same dumbbell that you used for the Crush Grip Curls, keep your arm held at a 90 degree angle and your wrist held strong. Lock out the pain and fight it for as long as you can.", "platform": "YouTube"}

You're about to see the best set of steps for that perfect deadlift you've ever seen. Step 1. Approach the bar so that your shins are one inch away from the barbell, putting it directly over the middle of your foot. Step 2. Without bending your shins to the barbell, grab the barbell just on the outside of your shins. Do not move the barbell. Step 3. Push your knees forward until your shins meet the barbell, dropping your hips down into the position. Step 4. Push your chest through and pull your shoulders down towards your hips. Step 5. Push your knees out into your forearms and drag the barbell directly up your legs, keeping it in contact all the way until you're standing straight up and down. Then, push your hips back and lower the bar down to the floor, keeping it in contact with your legs the entire time. And that my friends is how you do a perfect deadlift.

Place the dumbbell across the heel of your hand and webbing of your thumb. Roll them into the sides of your feet. Knees forward, chest up, lift, and place the dumbbells on your quads. Now, pull them into your body. Crunch down into them, rounding your upper back as you guide yourself down. Take a wide stance, driving your heels down, pushing your knees out. Push your chest to the ceiling. Imagine you're scooping your shoulder blades underneath you. Hold this. Tension established. Breathe in deeply. Inflating your core. Brace. Tension established. Drive your feet away. This will activate the lower body. Tension established. By tensioning all of these three regions of your body, you're creating stability. This allows the CNS to fire the target muscles more effectively. Here's how to get the perfect position for the dumbbells. As you allow them to drift out to the side, tension will eventually be shifted away from the pecs to the core. Cobra, Cobra, and Allison can cause discomfort in the shoulders. Keep the arm path more narrow to align with the chest fibers. With vertical forms, begin the press powerfully out of the bottom. The path will be angled backwards and finished directly over the shoulders. Lower back down under control, allowing the shoulder blades to move freely while holding them down.", "platform": "YouTube"}

And I asked him once, like, what do you do for your biceps? Your arms look crazy. And he goes, chin ups. Like that's a back exercise. He goes, no, it's a bicep exercise if you do it like this. And he jumps up on the bar, gets a curl grip, and rather than pulling his chest to the bar, he does this kind of like compound lift for his biceps. And then a dawn numbing. If I want my quads to really grow, it's not leg extensions, it's squats, right? If I want to build a bigger back, I'm not, it's not, you know, pullovers, it's rows, right? So it's like a compound lift for the biceps. In fact, we often accept that for triceps, like close grip bench press or dips. Right. But for some reason biceps, we don't do that.

Choose a weight that feels easy to complete the first two to three sets with. Eventually, a searing burn will start to set in at the end of each set. But no matter what, grit through it, starting to curl the dumbbells individually if you have to. Then for three sets, pick up one of the dumbbells and start to perform the waiter's curl. With a slight lean forward, imagine that you're curling the insides of your hands right to your throat.
