Up first, the seated leg curl for the hamstrings. This gets my knees nice and warm for squats, and I usually pick seated overlying leg curls because this study showed they cause about 1.5 times more muscle growth. Next I do Smith machine squats for the quads and glutes. Here I get as deep as I can and explode out of the hole. Doing these on the Smith allows me to push my last set to failure without worrying about dumping the bar. After that, it's the Romanian deadlift for the glutes and hamstrings. Here I focus on pushing my hips back without allowing my lower back to round. Using straps on these to smirk, your glutes and hams should be stronger than your grip. Then I do leg extensions for the quads. Here I set the seat back to get a deep stretch and erectus femoris. On my last set I do myoreps beyond failure. Basically, rest for a few seconds, crank another three reps, and repeat. Then I superset two sets of hip adductions for the inner thighs with two sets of hip abductions for the glutes. And then four sets of standing calf raises.", "platform": "YouTube"}

Here's what we found out. First, range of motion is the most important factor. You need to use a range of motion that gets the muscle fully stretched. You can do that by using a full range of motion, with a deep stretch, or by using long length partials. The second thing we found was the optimal lifting tempo. Each rep you do should last 2-8 seconds. That means you could do anything from a 1 second positive and a 1 second negative to a 1 second positive and a 7 second negative. The specific tempo doesn't seem to matter as much as simply controlling the negative and not just letting the weight free fall. And cheat reps do seem like a bad idea, but there's no study comparing ego lifting to strict form lifting yet. So that's the study we're going to do next, and I'll keep you guys posted on the results.", "platform": "YouTube"}

That's because they don't actually get the abdominal muscles close enough to failure to stimulate meaningful hypertrophy. This is still good exercise, but it is essentially just another form of cardio. Sure, you'll burn a few calories, but you're not building your six pack. Instead, to get your six pack to really pop, you'd be much better off doing progressive overload training just like you would for any other muscle. You do that by loading the abs with weight, and you really only need two exercises. One weight-loaded crunch and one leg raise. That's it. Try to add a rep or some weight each week. This way, the next time you cut down, your abs will pop much better.", "platform": "YouTube"}

Scientists had people train with either the seat up position with their hips flexed at around 90 degrees, or with the seat back position with their hips flexed at 40 degrees. After 10 weeks of training, here's the cool part, there was no difference in quad growth except one head called the rectus femoris grew way better with the seat back. It saw 170% more growth. This is a huge difference because the rectus femoris is a huge head. Does this mean that your quads are gonna look like J-Cutlers in eight weeks as long as you set the seat back? No, the actual amount of muscle gain was only a few millimeters. But compounded over years of training, I do think that doing your leg extensions with the seat back will lead to your best possible gains.", "platform": "YouTube"}

Now pull yourself under the bar with a close stance, placing the bar on top of your traps. Keep the grip close. Hands as close to the shoulders as you can manage. Hinge your back together and pull the bar down into your traps to tension the back. Slide the knees forward, placing the hips under the bar. Stand steady. Then step deliberately. One, two. Tuck and level your hips. Lightly screw the feet into the ground to help stabilize the hips. Breathe deep into your belly and brace like expecting a punch. Slide the hips back very slightly. Sink straight down between your legs. Depth may vary, but strive to lower to at least parallel. Keep the bar over the middle of your feet with equal balance from heel to toe.

Second, Reverse Nordics. These let you go much deeper than any leg extension machine will. Loop a band around a squat rack, kneel down, and lean back while keeping your hips straight. Go as low as you comfortably can and squeeze your quads to lift yourself up. Switch to body weight once you're strong enough. Third, Sissy Squats. Don't let the name fool you. These are hard. Grab a cable for balance and as you lean back, come up onto your toes and let your knees travel forward. Don't worry, studies show this won't hurt your knees. It'll make them stronger.

Well, the latest highest quality study in experience subjects actually found no difference between taking a set all the way to failure versus stopping one to two reps shy. But the problem is, if you never take any sets to failure, how are you supposed to know what one to two reps in the tank feels like? So that's why on pretty much every exercise, I just take the last set all the way to failure. Let me show you what that looks like for one of my leg days. So on the leg press, as you get close to failure, you're going to be really tempted to just let the weight free fall. But it's extremely important that as you do those last few reps, you still control the negative. Going to failure on the leg curl is kind of interesting because after you reach failure, you can't get the pad quite all the way down. You can still probably crank out another two or three partial reps. This is what I'll do on my last set. Going to failure on Bulgarian Swiss Squats is absolutely brutal, so I'd recommend doing two sets tops, your last set to failure. And again, with leg extensions, make sure you control the negative, especially as you get close to failure.", "platform": "YouTube"}

A scientist that recently discovered three solutions to their stubbornness. First, the standing calf raise is so insanely better than the seated calf raise. The gastropnemius grew more than 10 times more with standing versus seated, and the soleus grew the same. That's because when you bend your knee, you reduce the stretch on your gastro. But the key isn't that you're standing, the key is that you have a straight knee. Second, we all already knew that the calves needed deep stretch, but even more so than we realized. When you do calf raises, don't stop until you literally can't move the weight at all. This study found that the calves grew better from doing tiny partials beyond failure, even 8th reps and 10th reps. Though, until you literally can't budge the weight third, surprisingly, where you point your toes matters. Pointing your toes straight ahead hits the entire calf evenly. Pointing your toes out grows your inner calves more, and pointing your toes in grows your outer calves more. These researchers said that alternating your toes in and your toes out may cause the best growth of both heads.", "platform": "YouTube"}

If you take all five, you have a perfect leg press. The last one is what most people are confused about. First, place your feet for your goal. A higher foot position will target more glutes. A lower foot position will target more quads. How wide you go doesn't matter as much, but a round shoulder width is usually best. Point your toes slightly out. Second, control the weight down on every rep. Most people load up as many plates as they can, but then just let the weight free fall. It's better to go lighter and resist the weight on the negative. You want to notice your quads lengthening on the way down. Third, go as deep as you comfortably can. This is the most important step. For quad and glute growth, the deeper, the better. If you bottom out the machine, add an extra pad behind your back, or drop the weight back until you can get deep enough first, then build the weight back up. Fourth, grip the handles hard. As you do the positive, pull up on the handles to keep your glutes firmly planted on the seat. Fifth, lock out. It is generally safe to fully lock the knees out, but I try not to snap my knees at the top. I'll usually maintain a very slight knee bend at lock out.", "platform": "YouTube"}

I've been doing it for years and I want you to have it. Let's go. First, Cambered Bar Preacher curls for 4 sets of 12-15 reps. Push these as hard and as heavy as you possibly can, imagining that you're curling the weight up to the ceiling with your pinky and ring fingers. Next, Crush Grip Dumbbell Curls for 3 sets of 15 reps. These will get your biceps and forearms wider when looking from a front view. Keep your elbows in and constantly crush the dumbbell inwards with your grip as you curl up to the top. Then, Single Arm Dumbbell Hammer Curls with a staggered stance and the plane of your shoulders open up to the side, really controlling the negatives down and focusing on keeping the crease of your elbow facing the ceiling. Then, an isometric hold for absolute max time. Using the same dumbbell that you used for the Crush Grip Curls, keep your arm held at a 90 degree angle and your wrist held strong. Lock out the pain and fight it for as long as you can.", "platform": "YouTube"}

You're about to see the best set of steps for that perfect deadlift you've ever seen. Step 1. Approach the bar so that your shins are one inch away from the barbell, putting it directly over the middle of your foot. Step 2. Without bending your shins to the barbell, grab the barbell just on the outside of your shins. Do not move the barbell. Step 3. Push your knees forward until your shins meet the barbell, dropping your hips down into the position. Step 4. Push your chest through and pull your shoulders down towards your hips. Step 5. Push your knees out into your forearms and drag the barbell directly up your legs, keeping it in contact all the way until you're standing straight up and down. Then, push your hips back and lower the bar down to the floor, keeping it in contact with your legs the entire time. And that my friends is how you do a perfect deadlift.

Place the dumbbell across the heel of your hand and webbing of your thumb. Roll them into the sides of your feet. Knees forward, chest up, lift, and place the dumbbells on your quads. Now, pull them into your body. Crunch down into them, rounding your upper back as you guide yourself down. Take a wide stance, driving your heels down, pushing your knees out. Push your chest to the ceiling. Imagine you're scooping your shoulder blades underneath you. Hold this. Tension established. Breathe in deeply. Inflating your core. Brace. Tension established. Drive your feet away. This will activate the lower body. Tension established. By tensioning all of these three regions of your body, you're creating stability. This allows the CNS to fire the target muscles more effectively. Here's how to get the perfect position for the dumbbells. As you allow them to drift out to the side, tension will eventually be shifted away from the pecs to the core. Cobra, Cobra, and Allison can cause discomfort in the shoulders. Keep the arm path more narrow to align with the chest fibers. With vertical forms, begin the press powerfully out of the bottom. The path will be angled backwards and finished directly over the shoulders. Lower back down under control, allowing the shoulder blades to move freely while holding them down.", "platform": "YouTube"}

And I asked him once, like, what do you do for your biceps? Your arms look crazy. And he goes, chin ups. Like that's a back exercise. He goes, no, it's a bicep exercise if you do it like this. And he jumps up on the bar, gets a curl grip, and rather than pulling his chest to the bar, he does this kind of like compound lift for his biceps. And then a dawn numbing. If I want my quads to really grow, it's not leg extensions, it's squats, right? If I want to build a bigger back, I'm not, it's not, you know, pullovers, it's rows, right? So it's like a compound lift for the biceps. In fact, we often accept that for triceps, like close grip bench press or dips. Right. But for some reason biceps, we don't do that.

Choose a weight that feels easy to complete the first two to three sets with. Eventually, a searing burn will start to set in at the end of each set. But no matter what, grit through it, starting to curl the dumbbells individually if you have to. Then for three sets, pick up one of the dumbbells and start to perform the waiter's curl. With a slight lean forward, imagine that you're curling the insides of your hands right to your throat.

You can even place it a little bit wider. Either way, it works, bitch. You want to make sure that your ass is glued to the seat right here.

This means that when you push off and you bring your knees to your chest, you are solely using your quads. You drive out and you'll only feel it here, okay? If you want to hit your hips and like your outer thighs, you want your feet to be wide on the platform, okay? And you want your feet pointed outwards ever so slightly. This means that when you bring your knees to your chest, you'll feel it all here and when you drive out, you are using this part of your legs. If you want to hit your hamstrings and your glutes, so your hamstrings are the back of your legs and your glutes is your bum, you want your feet high up and you want it a little bit wider than in the center, okay? Again, bring your knees to your chest and you're going to use your hamstrings to drive out and that's where you'll hit. And then if you want to hit your calves, you want to put your feet on the bottom of the platform, half on, half off and you basically just want to do tippy toes. So you push it out with the front of your feet and you'll feel that solely in your calves. So next time you jump on the leg press, don't be clueless.

Lat Pull-Down Machine: This machine typically has a fixed bar and is designed for a more controlled movement. You sit down, adjust the knee pad, and pull the bar down towards your chest. This setup can help isolate the latissimus dorsi muscles effectively and is often easier for beginners to use.\n\nThis can be great for building foundational strength in your lats. Since it provides a fixed path, it helps beginners focus on form and technique.\n\n2. Lat Cable Pull-Down: This variation uses a cable system, which allows for a more fluid range of motion. You can adjust the angle of your pull and change your grip more easily, which can target different parts of the back muscles. It also allows for more versatility in your workout routine.\n\nIt adds versatility to your routine. By changing grips (wide, narrow, or reverse), you can target different areas of your back. Plus, the cable system allows for a more natural movement, which can help with muscle activation and stability.\n\nBy alternating between these two in your workouts, you can ensure comprehensive development of your back muscles, improve muscle balance, and prevent injuries. \n\nRemember Diet is 80% of your results ! So ensure that with doing the right workouts you are also sleeping and eating correctly ! \n\n#backgoals #unbigyourback #workoutmotivationforgirls #fitness ", "author": "Magnimise - Glutes builder\ud83c\udf51", "platform": "TikTok", "transcript": "The secret to having my back like this is this machine. So the lat pull down machine, it's not the same as the lat pull down cable machine. This one I can actually focus on one arm at a time. And then what I do is focus on both arms after. So I'll do about maybe six to nine reps, depending on how I feel. And then I'll do 10 reps at the end with both arms. Make sure you repeat this four times and let me know how it goes. And make sure you take a picture of your back before and after your transformation, because trust me, you'll see progress in three months time."}

Listen, there's a few major mistakes that people make when they do dumbbell curls. And I want to share them with you in this video, but first I'd appreciate a follow. The first mistake that I see people making is choosing a weight that's too heavy. Listen, dude, anybody can curl 60 pounds if you're swinging using your whole body weight. Your bicep's ain't that strong, bro. What I want you to do is slow the rep down, make sure you control the movement, keep your core nice and tight. That's the first fix. The second mistake is not twisting your pinkies to the sky. Anytime you do a curl, you want to make sure you get a full contraction in that bicep. And for a full contraction, you need to rotate your pinky towards your bicep. Now, the third mistake that I see is people doing curls like this. Too fast, one after the other with succession instead of having a nice, slow controlled bicep curl that warrants a good stretch and a good contraction. Now add these tips to your next arm day and watch as your biceps explode. I'll see you in the next one."}

Next, I want you to hold an offset grip with your thumb butted up against the end of the dumbbell. And what this is doing is it's placing majority of that weight of that dumbbell on the outside of your hand, making it harder for you to supinate at the top, which is gonna force you to squeeze your bicep a lot more.

Adjust the barbell in accordance with your height. Choose your working weight. Stand under the barbell so that it rests on the shoulders (just below the neck).\n\u2022 Hold the bar with both hands and an upper grip at wider than shoulder width then lift it from the rack.\n\u2022 Take a step back and stand with your feet wider than shoulder width then slightly turn your toes out to the sides. Keep your back straight. The head should always be raised; if you lower your eyes, you will lose your balance. This is the starting position.\n\u2022 As you inhale slowly squat, bending your knees and pulling the pelvis back. Continue to go down until the hips are parallel with the floor.\n\u2022 As you exhale rise back up to the starting position, transferring the weight to the heels and contracting the target muscles to their maximum point.\n\u2022 Perform the required number of repetitions. Place the barbell on the rack.\n\nWarning\n\u2022 This exercise should be taken very seriously. If you have problems with your back, choose another exercise. If you are healthy then follow the technique to the letter and do not tilt the trunk back or forward, as this can cause back injury. \n\u2022 The squat is a safe exercise only if the correct technique is followed. \n\u2022 With proper technique the knees and the toes should be on the same line. If the knees go out beyond the toes then you are at risk of overloading the knee joints.\n\n#fitnesstips #fitnessmotivation #gym #fitness", "author": "WORKOUTS FOR HOME AND GYM", "platform": "TikTok", "transcript": "you"}

This means that when you push off and you bring your knees to your chest, you are solely using your quads. You drive out and you'll only feel it here, okay? If you want to hit your hips and like your outer thighs, you want your feet to be wide on the platform, okay? And you want your feet pointed outwards ever so slightly.

So let me show you how to do it the right way. First thing you want to do is ladies and fellas, you want to put your ego to the side. Because a lot of y'all put six plates on here, ten plates on here, but you only look like this. Come on bro, what are you doing? What are you going to get out of that? Nothing. So what you want to do is first of all put your ego, throw that away. Don't even bring that to the table when you get on this machine. First thing you want to do is realize that you can bias each part of the leg, whatever you want to target, whether that be the quads or the hamstrings. In order to target the quads, what you want to do is have your feet go on the pad and close together with a good range of motion. You don't want to be coming here and saying, oh I'm doing leg press, target them up, I know you're not. You want to come here. You see how different that looks? My lower back is not coming off the pad. I'm bracing myself. I'm dug into the pad. My back is not coming off the pad and I'm pressing through the middle of my feet right here just like this. This is going to target all quads. Now, Qwambi, people say, hey Qwambi, I want to target my hamstrings and glutes. I got you. What you would do is bring your feet up high and wide on the pad. That's going to target more hamstrings and glutes. You want to make sure still you're doing the movement and you're stopping when you feel like your back is about to roll off the pad. You don't want your back to be coming off the pad like this. This is going to lead to back pain and so many other problems down the line. What you want to do is, once again, you want to brace yourself, keeping yourself here, making sure your back is not rolled off the pad, pushing through the middle of your feet as well. This is going to target all hamstrings and glutes. Another thing, you get on this machine and a lot of you guys can't even do the same range of motion as you just seen me do. What you want to do is, the back pad here goes up or backwards. What you want to do is bring it as far back as you can to where you can get the best range of motion. You see that? That's how you perform a leg press. If you really want your legs to grow, you already know where to go. Tap in, man. Let's work."}

So let me show you how to do it the right way. Cause this ain't the way to go. Alright, first you want to start with a setup. You want to start by resting on your forearms just like this. But you do not want to have your hands tied together like this. You want to have your palms facing down with your arms straight just like this. And your feet, you don't want to be too wide like this and you don't want to be too close. You want to be right at hip width just like this. Now you don't want to be retracted in the movement just like this because you're not going to get the most out of your core. So what you want to do is protract like this and you want to stay here the whole time. Now you're going to feel it in your back every time if you got your head up like this with an arch in your back. So what you want to do is stay looking down the whole entire time. And what you want to do is squeeze the glutes, tucking the pelvis in just like this and this is going to engage the core. Now from here after you got everything in position, all you want to do from here is pull your elbows towards your body just like this which is going to engage the core even more. Alright, let's put it all together. First you're going to start out by resting on our forearms just like this. Want to make sure that it's a straight line between our shoulder and our elbow just like this with our arms about shoulder width apart. Then we want to make sure our palms are on the ground just like this. From here we want to make sure that our feet are about hip width. Want to make sure that it's a straight line between our ankles and toes just like this. You don't want to be like this and you don't want to be like this. From here you want to keep your head down. You don't want to be looking up with an arch in your back because it's going to leave you hurt. So we're going to look down, keeping our head down. And you don't want to be retracted in the movement. You want to go ahead and pull your shoulder blades up. Then you want to tuck your pelvis. Go ahead and squeeze your glutes to get more out of the car. And lastly all you want to do is just pull your elbows towards your body like this. We're just going to activate your core some more. And this is how you do a plank.

From here, we're gonna start with a height back of the kettlebell aggressively. I'm not letting it drag across the floor. I'm gonna hike it back so it gets up towards my butt. From there, I'm gonna do aggressively squeeze my glutes. Like there's a quarter rolling down my butt crack, and I gotta make sure that quarter doesn't hit the ground. In addition to that, I'm straightening my legs so my head goes up towards the ceiling, and I'm not leaning back. Last thing is don't lift with your upper body.

You're going to get all your muscles in your body firing from your shoulders, back, abs, legs, and your hips. I'm using the 70 pound kettlebell right now so after about 10 reps I can totally feel the fatigue. A good tip for anybody that's just learning how to do the kettlebell swing, start with the ladder weight, practice on the swing. Engage your back and shoulders and extend through with your hips. Another benefit is that it's a functional movement that helps for daily living and last but not least it helps improve balance and coordination."}

When I lost 105 lbs naturally in my early 20s, it was a bit depressing to lose all the weight but still feeling like I had an abundance of skin. Years later when I turned 30 I lost 100 lbs again... this time it really got to me. Going from 245 lbs to 145 left me feeling deflated to say the least. When I started my current Journey August 1st of 2022 I weighed 215 lbs. Currently I'm maintaining 169-172ish that's still about 45 lbs gone! It took about a year, but I'm noticing my skin and physique is a lot more toned. Especially in my legs! I didn't have a goal when I set out on this current journey. I just didn't feel comfortable at 215. My goal was never to get down to 145 either. More and more I'm realizing my goal is to just be consistent. And to do the exercises my body craves, and to simplify my routine so it's as sustainable as possible. I don't want to have to lose 100 lbs again ever in my life. By doing these swings daily, I'm toning, and REALLY I love my walks! Just those two things alone have helped me lose weight, and maintain my weight while still enjoying somewhat regular food!

Here\u2019s why it should be a staple in your workout routine:\n\n1. **Promotes Muscle Retention:** As we age, muscle loss becomes a reality. Dumbbell bench presses help combat this by targeting multiple muscle groups (chest, shoulders, and triceps), ensuring you maintain and even build muscle strength over time.\n\n2. **Enhances Shoulder Stability:** Dumbbells require more control than machines or barbells, engaging stabilizer muscles around the shoulders. This increased activation strengthens these supporting muscles, reducing the risk of injury\u2014a crucial benefit as we get older.\n\n3. **Improves Joint Health:** With free weights, you can move more naturally through your own range of motion. This reduces stress on the joints compared to fixed movements, making it easier on the shoulders and elbows, especially beneficial for aging joints.\n\n4. **Balances Muscle Strength:** Dumbbells force each side of your body to work independently, helping to correct any strength imbalances. This balanced development is vital for preventing injuries and ensuring even muscle growth, especially as we age.\n\n5. **Boosts Bone Density:** Weight-bearing exercises like the dumbbell bench press stimulate bone growth and help maintain bone density, which is crucial for preventing osteoporosis and fractures as we age.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Want to learn more about effective exercises for staying fit and strong over 40?

Well, the truth is there's really no quote-unquote proper way to do this exercise because there's many variations that can be viable. With that in mind, if the tricep push-down doesn't feel too great for you or your triceps aren't grown, here are some variations I can recommend. First off, if you're right up against the cable, I don't recommend doing a tricep push-down this way because it forces your shoulder into internal rotation. Most likely in this position, you're gonna have a hard time progressing on this exercise. Well, on top of that, if you tend to get shoulders comfort doing a tricep push-down, this internal rotation can be the culprit. I actually recommend that you take a step back so that now your shoulders are in a more neutral position here instead of here. This is how most people are gonna be doing a tricep push-down. What I actually recommend for a lot of people, however, maybe you have a hard time feeling your triceps in the first place. Instead of finishing in this marmin front position with your shoulders more flexed, what you can do is extend so that your arms are against the side of your body. One problem you can find is that the rope isn't really long enough. What you do is take off the rope and perform this exercise at unilateral. Good luck."}

So let me show you how to do it the right way because this ain't the way to go. Alright first you want to start the set up. You want to make sure that the pulley is at a level so that the bar rests right in your head height just like this. Now you want to grab the ball with an overhand grip but you don't want a full grip. You want to make sure that your thumbs are in alignment with the rest of your fingers. Now from here you do not want to be pressing just like this with your elbows in front of your body because you're not going to get the most out of your tricep. So what you want to do is pin your elbows to the side of your body and then extend down while keeping your elbows in that same position the whole entire time. Now a lot of you guys tend to not feel it in your triceps because your shoulders are moving all over the place just like this. Before starting this movement what you want to do is roll your shoulders back and down, pin them there with your chest up the whole entire time just like this. Now you don't want to be upright like this when doing the movement because your range of motion is going to be very limited so what you want to do is take a step back then you want to lean your torso forward slightly like this which allows you to get a full range of motion on that tricep. Now a lot of you guys experience pain in the wrist because when you do the movement here your wrist is bent throughout the whole entire movement which is going to cause unnecessary strain so what you want to do is straighten your wrist and keep it there the whole entire time. Alright let's put it all together and start with the settle. You want to make sure that this pulley is at a height to where the bar rest right at your head just like this. Then you're going to grab it with an overhand grip making sure that your thumbs are in alignment with the rest of your fingers. And what we're going to do is take a step back slightly lean forward just like this then we're going to pin our elbows to the side of our body. We're going to roll our shoulders back and down with our chest up just like this. Now we're ready and all you want to do from here is push down. You want to make sure that your wrist is in a neutral position the whole entire time. You do not want to bend it. You want to come back up slow and control for that full stretch while still making sure that we're keeping our elbows pinned to the side of our body and our shoulders are backing down. Then we're going to come back for that full extension. Treating it like we're trying to snap the bar to get a better mind muscle connection. And this is how you do a tricep push down. So if you don't want to do this you want to know how to go or you already know how to go. Let's work."}

So as I finish this rep, I'm not just going straight down. Really my mind, I want this thing to get fucking ripped in half. But same procedure as normal. As many good reps with a hard squeeze, with full range of motion as possible. And then once I can't do any more of that, no chance am I just gonna rack it. I've still got a ton of partials in the tank. First\u3041 I'm gonna suck it up. That's boring. Lyeg privately used this patch. This is \u043f\u043e\u0439\u0434lar\u0131. This is motherfucking funny. I went to mine and thrown a plate on the side of the stack, but dude, triceps are fucking fully inflated."}

Personally, I like to use the rope. I feel like I get a better full extension with using the ropes. You want to start by stepping away from the cable column and then all we're going to do is we're going to push our hips back. So a slight hinge at the hips while keeping your core nice and engaged. So you want that tightness that you would get as if you sneeze or cough while keeping your back nice and straight. Now this is key when it comes to tricep push downs, okay? You want to keep those elbows nice and tight by the side of your body because all you really are going to be doing is extending all the way, keeping a nice straight arm and bending at the elbow, slowly bringing the rope back up to the forehead. So it's really just an extension and bending at the elbow, okay? What you don't want to do is you don't want to move your arms with it. This is not going to really work the triceps. Keep the elbows nice and tight by your side and then fully extend the arms out nice and straight. Like you see the triceps right now? They're flexing, okay?"}
